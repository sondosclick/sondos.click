# Installing the Zscaler Root CA on openSUSE Tumbleweed (WSL Edition)

Ah, **Zscaler** — our favorite corporate “friend” who loves to play middleman between us and the internet.  
Because who *doesn’t* enjoy HTTPS interception at 9 AM on a Monday? 😅  

If you’re running **openSUSE Tumbleweed** on **WSL** and everything suddenly breaks — `curl`, `wget`, `zypper`, even `git` — congratulations! You’ve just met Zscaler’s SSL inspection. Let’s fix it so you can get back to doing real work (and maybe a bit of complaining).

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step: Making openSUSE Trust Zscaler

openSUSE uses **p11-kit** and the `update-ca-certificates` system to manage trusted roots.  
We’ll show you two easy ways to install that corporate CA certificate (before Zscaler ruins your day again).

---

### 🧙‍♂️ Option 1: Use `trust anchor` (Recommended)

1. **Download the Zscaler Root CA certificate**

   Grab it from your corporate SharePoint or the ZIA Admin Portal (usually a `.pem` or `.crt` file).  
   Example (fictional) link:  
   [Zscaler_Root_CA.pem](https://example.com/sites/Zscaler/Zscaler_Root_CA.pem)

2. **Add it to the system trust store**

    ```bash
   sudo trust anchor ~/Zscaler_Root_CA.pem
    ```

3. Verify it worked

    ```bash
    trust list | grep Zscaler
    ```
    
    If you see the certificate listed as an anchor — you’re golden!


### 🧰 Option 2: Manually Copy and Update

1. Move the certificate to the anchors directory

    ```bash
    sudo cp Zscaler_Root_CA.pem /etc/pki/trust/anchors/
    ```

    (You can also use /usr/share/pki/trust/anchors/ for system-level trust.)

2. Regenerate the CA store

```bash
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

3. Celebrate. Maybe sarcastically.
Your Linux tools should now stop complaining about “unknown issuer” errors. 🎉

### 🕵️‍♀️ Why This Matters

Zscaler intercepts HTTPS traffic, re-signs it with its own root certificate, and pretends it’s doing you a favor.
Without trusting that CA, every secure connection fails miserably.
Adding the cert ensures your tools — curl, wget, zypper, pip, etc. — behave again.

### 🔍 Enterprise Notes

- Internal docs usually recommend copying the cert to /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt or automating this with scripts.

- For containers, Git, or Python, you might need to append the cert to their own CA bundles manually.

> (Yes, even Docker doesn’t escape Zscaler’s reach. 🧟‍♂️)

### ✅ Quick Trust Check

Run:
```bash
openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -showcerts
```

If you don’t see “unknown issuer,” congrats — your system now trusts Zscaler (begrudgingly).

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Zscaler breaks SSL. We fix SSL. Circle of life.
- Use sudo trust anchor for the cleanest install on openSUSE.
- Don’t forget to verify — trust, but verify (literally).
- Optional: complain to IT for deploying Zscaler in the first place. 😉
