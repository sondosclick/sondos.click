# sondos.click — Static blog for GitHub Pages

This is a minimal Jekyll site intended to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

How to use:
1. Add these files to the root of your repository (keep the folder structure).
2. Commit & push to `main`.
3. In your GitHub repository settings -> Pages: choose Branch `main`, folder `/ (root)`, save.
4. Wait a minute — your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/sondos.click` or at the custom URL you set.

Adding posts:
- Create a new Markdown file in `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
- Include front matter (layout: post, title, date, tags).
- The homepage lists posts automatically.

Customizing:
- Edit `_config.yml` for site title, description, and slogan.
- Change colors in `assets/css/style.css`.
- If you prefer a different theme, set `theme:` in `_config.yml` to another GitHub Pages-supported theme.

Want me to push these files into your repository and enable GitHub Pages for you? I can prepare a branch and open a pull request — tell me to proceed and I'll push the files (I will not push changes without your permission).
