## About – sondos.click

### About this site, the cloud, and other things that look simple

There is a widespread white lie in technology:
that everything is simple if you know where to click.

Usually it is *two clicks*.
It is always *two clicks*.
Until it is not.

**sondos.click** was born from exactly that. From years of hearing that complex, fragile, and expensive systems can be fixed as easily as changing the volume on your phone. Spoiler: no.

This blog exists to tell what lives **between those two clicks**.

### Who writes here

No photo staring at the horizon.
No comeback story.
No guru.

Here you will find someone who has spent **too many years** working in technology to believe in miraculous shortcuts, but **enough years to stay curious**.

I work in **cloud consulting**, mostly in **AWS**, and these days I sit in that limbo called *Technical Manager*: the place where you do not touch everything, but you have to understand almost everything; where you coordinate people who know a lot and your job is to make the complicated seem reasonable.

I do not always succeed.

### The obsession with simple (which is not the same as easy)

Over time I have developed a certain allergy to unnecessary complexity.
To buzzwords.
To diagrams that only exist to impress.
To solutions that look deep but solve nothing.

I care about **simplicity done right**.
The kind that only shows up when you know the problem inside out.

Like well-designed objects: they look obvious... until you try to replicate them.
Or like certain cloud architectures that, from the outside, "have nothing," but work precisely because someone decided to remove everything extra.

That process - understand, get it wrong, strip layers, start again - is what this site is about.

### Experience, mistakes, and a long memory

I have worked in support, projects, deployments, migrations, and in situations where the worst part was not the technical failure but the rush to assign blame.

I have seen brilliant ideas work and other equally brilliant ones burn in production.
I have learned more from what went wrong than from what went right.
And I still believe that anyone who never makes mistakes is either lying or not doing anything interesting.

After all these years, one thing is clear:
technology changes fast, but **mistakes repeat with admirable precision**.

### What you will find here (and what you will not)

At **sondos.click** you will find:

* reflections on cloud and AWS,
* real project experience,
* technical ideas explained without epic drama,
* and opinions that do not try to please everyone.

You will not find:

* positive thinking applied to architectures,
* promises of success,
* universal recipes,
* or blind faith in this month's trend.

This is not a place for motivation.
It is a place to **understand a little better why things are the way they are**.

### If you made it this far

You probably work in technology.
You probably nodded in meetings without fully knowing what was being discussed.
You probably wondered at some point if the problem was you.

It was not.

This blog is for anyone who suspects that **not knowing everything is not a defect**, but the right starting point. For those who would rather learn slowly than repeat fast phrases.

And for those who already know that, almost never, it is only two clicks.
