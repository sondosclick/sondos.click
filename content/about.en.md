This site is a notebook of ideas, stories, and small experiments about cloud, AI, product culture, and that point where complexity stops being visible but keeps calling the shots.

I’m interested in what happens when we automate too much, measure what we shouldn’t, and delegate decisions that are still, at their core, human.

If you want to collaborate or say hi, you’ll find me on GitHub.
